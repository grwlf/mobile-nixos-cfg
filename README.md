What is it?
-----------

This is an umbrella repo for my Mobile NixOS experiemnts. My primary target
device is PinePhone. The repo will link other valuable repos as Git submodules.
Also I expect it to contain scripts and customized configurations.

Usage
-----

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/grwlf/mobile-nixos-cfg`
2. `./build.sh`
